# Bivariate-boxplot

The notebook contains a description and examples of bivariate methods for identifying outliers, such as the bivariate boxplot and the bagplot. Additionally, it provides instructions on how to execute R code from within Jupyter, as bivariate boxplots and bagplots are not available in Python.
